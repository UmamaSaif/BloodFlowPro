# BloodFlowPro

Collaborators: Umama Saif, Aamina Bokhari, Ahmad Javaid

BloodFlowPro is a comprehensive blood donation management system developed as a semester project using the MVC architecture. The project was a collaborative effort involving detailed planning and documentation from the elaboration phase to the implementation phase.

Development Highlights:

Planning & Documentation: We started with vision documents and created detailed use case diagrams, system sequence diagrams, component diagrams, and deployment diagrams, adhering to the 4+1 view model.

Design & Architecture: The system was designed using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.

Implementation: The project culminated in a functional blood donation management system that efficiently handles donor and recipient information, blood inventory, and donation processes.

The project demonstrates our ability to work collaboratively, follow structured software development methodologies, and implement a complex system from initial concept to final deployment.
